=Mockito=

  * descriptive, refactorable, proven EasyMockish syntax.
  * simple and intuitive way of testing: run -> verify behavior. 
  Other words: you ask questions about interactions after execution instead setting up expectations beforehand.
  * explicit, selective verification allows creating more specific test methods 
  concentrated on testing only selected interaction: one interaction - one verification. It's also increases readability.
  * verification errors are very readable - click on stack trace to see failed verification in test, 
  click on exception's cause to navigate to actual interaction in code.
  
===Get started===

Put mockito-all-x.jar on classpath  
  
==Sample==

  import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;
  
  //let's mock a List!
  List mockedList = mock(List.class);
  
  //stubbing
  stub(mockedList.get(0)).toReturn("first element");
  
  //using mock object
  mockedList.add("one");
  mockedList.clear();
  
  //verification
  verify(mockedList).add("one");
  verify(mockedList).clear();

===More details===

  * Mocks concrete classes as well as interfaces
  * All created mocks are friendly, e.g: methods return 0, false, empty collections or just nulls 
  Once created mocks are ready to use without setting up any behavior/expectations
  * Less constrained verification/stubbing using argument matchers (anyObject(), anyString(), etc.)
  * Allows verification in order
  * Verification errors have clean stack trace: Click on first trace element - see what interaction failed 
  Trace elements from inside of Mockito library are not shown
  * Very similar to EasyMock (page with differences in under construction)
  * Single-jar distribution (mockito-all-x.jar) includes java source inside jar
  * Zip distribution (mockito-x.zip) contains javadoc and all jars    

===Ideas? Suggestions? Problems?===

If you have any suggestions, find documentation unclear or you found a bug, write here:

===Limitations===

  * Cannot mock final classes
  * Cannot mock final methods - their normal behavior is executed
  * Cannot mock equals(), toString() and hashCode() - those are always implemented by mocks

Hats down before EasyMock folks for their ideas on beautiful and refactorable mocking syntax. 
Mockito is heavily inspired by ideas from EasyMock. 
Moreover, Mockito was started as one big refactoring of EasyMock. Some code and API (argument matchers) is the same as in EasyMock.

Some other mocking frameworks share similar concepts as Mockito:
