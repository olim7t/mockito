How to release version x.x

1. make sure license headers are there: replace_headers.rb
2. make sure you committed all that needs to be in the release
3. branch: 

svn copy -m "branched before release" https://mockito.googlecode.com/svn/trunk https://mockito.googlecode.com/svn/branches/x.x

4. check out branch to some clean folder:

svn co https://mockito.googlecode.com/svn/branches/x.x mockito-x.x

5. update version in the build.xml file to x.x
7. commit changes to build.xml
6. test the release:

ant test.release

7. build javadocs:

ant release.javadoc

8. add javadocs to svn:

svn add javadoc/*

8. update mime-type on javadoc so that it is nicely viewable in browsers:

cd releasing
python mime-types.rb

9. commit javadocs (takes fricking long)

9. check if javadocs look beautiful over the web
